The journey to get there, whether by train or hiking the Inca Trail, adds to the magic of the experience. The ancient ruins, set against the backdrop of the lush Andes mountains, are absolutely breathtaking. I recommend arriving early to watch the morning mist lift, revealing the site in all its glory. Exploring the terraces, temples, and stone structures was like stepping back in time. It’s truly a bucket-list destination and worth every effort to visit!"</i> </p>

I visited during the peak season, and while the site itself is incredible, the crowds made some areas feel congested. The steep paths can be tough to navigate, so wear sturdy shoes and be prepared for a workout. The surrounding landscape is spectacular, especially from the Sun Gate, so it’s worth the extra hike. Despite the crowds, it’s a fascinating glimpse into the Inca civilization and a must-see for history and nature lovers alike."</i> </p>

The guides do an excellent job of bringing the history to life, explaining the significance of each area and the ingenuity of the Inca people.
