I visited during the official climbing season, which meant it was busy, and at times the trail felt overcrowded. The ascent is steep, with rocky and dusty paths that can be tough on the legs, so sturdy footwear is essential. The view from the summit was gorgeous, but clouds rolled in quickly, limiting visibility. I recommend checking the weather forecast closely. Even if climbing isn't your thing, the mountain’s presence is awe-inspiring from nearby spots like Lake Kawaguchi, which offer serene views without the exertion. A must-see if you’re in Japan, but prepare accordingly if you plan to hike!"</i> </p>

The climb was challenging but incredibly rewarding, with breathtaking views at every stage. Reaching the summit at sunrise was like standing on top of the world—absolutely surreal. The trails are well-marked, and the mountain huts along the way were a lifesaver for rest and warmth. I also loved exploring the surrounding area; Lake Kawaguchi and the Chureito Pagoda provided stunning views of the mountain from a distance. Whether you climb or admire it from afar, Mount Fuji is a must-see destination that truly embodies the spirit of Japan."</i> </p>
